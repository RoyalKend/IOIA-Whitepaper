****A calculation has been made to estimate the profit at the end of the investment plan, taking into account the return of hedge funds over the last 8 years.

&#x20;** **_**In the best-case scenario**_ a profit of $30 315 resulted, resulting in a passive income of $505/month;

_**Under normal conditions**_ a profit of $14 805 resulted, resulting in a passive income of $248/month.

This profile is calculated with an initial investment of $700, this brings an ROI of 4300% respectively 2110%&#x20;

After 6 months of investing in Pantera Capital, we will make our second investment. The second investment will be in a renewable energy farm.

<mark style="color:blue;">**How will it be done?**</mark>

Each NFT holder will be able to invest a maximum of $1000. We will have a similar process: Now the fundraising will be done through a variation of our $IOe token.

Each NFT can buy a maximum of 1000 $IOe. The money raised from the IOe will be invested in the renewable farm and the profit will be added to the coin pool.

At the end of the investment plan, you can sell all the coins you own, so you can take both the profit you collected and your initial investment.\
