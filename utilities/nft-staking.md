# NFT Staking

By staking your NFT, you become eligible to receive passive income.

Once staked, also you will start to earn credit that will give you the chance to invest in future opportunities.\

\
After staking the NFT, you will hold within the platform 700 $IO tokens equivalent to $700, this represents the fraction that each NFT holds of the initial investment in Pantera Capital and from which it will generate profit.

How will the passive income be distributed to the NFT holder?

The interest earned from the investment in Pantera Capital will be added to the $IO token pool so it will increase in value.
