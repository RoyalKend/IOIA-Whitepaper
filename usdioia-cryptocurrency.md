**You can sell the tokens anytime on our platform to Smart-Contract where IOIO collects the interest from the investment fund in $USDC.**

In the best-case scenario at the end of the investment plan, one $IO token is valued at $42.97. !! If you keep your 700 $IO tokens until the end of the plan they will be worth $30,305, a monthly income of $505/month !!!

At the end of the investment plan, you can sell all the coins you own, so you can take your accumulated profit and your initial investment.\

<mark style="color:blue;">**When can I take the profit out if I don't want to stay until the end?**</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>There will be exact times when you can take out the profit. The periods when profit withdrawal is allowed are determined by the conditions of the fund you invest in and the community.

The investment plan in Pantera Capital is for 5 years, but if unfavorable conditions are encountered and a majority of the community votes to withdraw investment, that is what we will do.\
